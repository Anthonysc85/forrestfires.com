This is a personal website I developed for a client using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
I built a projects page which showcases photos and has on click functionality that expands the photos
to a full screen view.
The purchase page used the Snipcart API so that the client can manage and receive payments for the 
various artworks that are up for sale.
